Mrs weather_bee
The app has 3 screens, the first screen displays the app name, my name, student number, the app logo and includes 2 buttons one to exit the app and one to go to the next page, which is out second screen, referred to as the “main” screen. The main screen includes a space where the user can input their values using a parallel array, with two button one to clear the user input so they can renter it and one to go to the next page which is the third screen that displays the user entered information, it will calculate and display the average screen time for that given week and include a button to go back to the main screen if the user wants to make changes or include certain details.

According to Bill Gates “Don’t make the same mistake twice, spend time and thought to make a solid decision the first time so that you don’t revisit the issue unnecessarily”.
Do you usually find yourself piled up with a lot of work and you wonder how?
Well lucky for you I have the answer to your question, that is entirely because your time is not managed properly, due to that tasks get delayed meaning they pile up. I am creating an app called the “mrs weather_bee”. To help you manage your time efficiently 
 The mrs weather_bee app is an app that helps users manage their time, by setting goals and breaking them down into smaller tasks to be achieved on time by helping them plan ahead.
The app is user friendly and does not discriminate, it is very good for students of any age group, and adults in workplaces. The app is designed to help you get that eight hour sleep you deserve while still meeting your deadlines. According to josh Billings “Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there”. Many college students may find the academic experience very stressful (K. J. Swick, 1987)
For first year students adapting to time management may be a bit of a hassle, because they are transitioning from tertiary education where they are spoon fed, followed after for submissions etc to college/varsity where they may be away from home, all by themselves without anybody telling them what to do, the amount of freedom is immense and may too much to handle for many.
*Transitions are very difficult for first-year students.
*A crucial component of a successful first-year transfer is time management. 
*Students who receive time management instruction succeed and stay in school longer.

The design considerations 
For the logo of the app, I used the following image

 (the image couldnt be added) i provided a link at the end to the word document 

The image is authentic because it shows the different types of weathers that we have, which is what the app will do, help the user plan ahead. And in the PowerPoint presentation different symbols showcasing time are shown.

How I will utilise GitHub and its actions 
1.	I will create a GitHub respiratory 
* Push my work through to the respiratory 
2	Configure GitHub actions
*I will create a workflow file
*Define my workflow
        3. Running and monitoring workflows
	*I will trigger workflows
	*Monitor my workflows
     4. Advanced workflows 
	*I will display it to a server or cloud
	*Run scheduled jobs
Following these methods will allow me to efficiently manage, test, and launch my mrs weather_bee app using GitHub and its Actions. GitHub Actions is a robust and versatile tool for automating many areas of my development workflow.

Calculating average = total temperature/ 7(days)
